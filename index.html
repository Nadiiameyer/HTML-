<h2 id="cat">Van life with a cat</h2>
<p> Are you thinking about hitting the open road?<br>
    Traveling around the country in a campervan and living by the rules of the road, enjoying every single moment. <br>
    Lots of people are joining vanlife and many are doing <a href="https://www.chasingthewildgoose.com/vanlife-with-dog/">van life with a dog</a>
    What about van life with a cat? <br>
    You see many people out there with their dogs but is it possible to travel in your campervan with a cat?<br>

<h3 id="guide">Guide to Vanlife with Cats</h3>
<p>When I was still working full time, I would research everything related to van living and how to plan for such a transition. <br>
    I attempted to research living in a van with a <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/42/5e/f4/425ef4083e4ca9a92e52b4b43645e085.jpg">cat,</a> but came up mostly empty with information. <br>
    There's definitely information out there on living in an RV with a cat, but it's just not the same. <br>
    A van is much smaller and stealthier than an RV. <br>
    And most of the people who had written articles about living in their RV with a cat stayed at state parks or RV parks,<br>
    which I knew was not going to be the case with us.<br>

    We wanted to stay in national forests whenever possible, but could also be staying at Walmart parking lots and rest stops when needed. <br>
    I felt like I prepared as much as I could, but at the end of the day, <br>
    I was admittedly scared that our cat Mazy was either going to freak out and attempt to jump out of the van,<br>
    or become sullen and depressed from downsizing to such a small space. As I sit in the van right now and write this, <br>
    she is sleeping soundly. We're also in a Walmart parking lot with car doors slamming, carts rumbling, and engines revving.<br>

<h4 id="can you?">Can You Do Van Life With A Cat?</h4>
<p>Can you even do van life with a cat? This is a question I personally have had as well as many others that are considering van life.<br>
    There are many logistics to consider like where to put the litter box, is the van big enough for a cat, how will you exercise it,<br>
    will the cat like driving and the list goes on. Even though there are quite a few pretty big logistical concerns, <br>
    the many people who have done van life with a <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/91/4f/12/914f12bf888f1780a839f2f121a0ae3b.jpg">cat</a>  would say yes, you absolutely can.<br>
